# World Weather Analysis

## Project Overview
Jack loves the PlanMyTrip app. Beta testers love it too. Theyâ€™ve recommended a few changes to take the app to the next level. 
- Specifically, they recommend adding the weather description to the weather data I've already retrieved in this module. 
- Then, I will have the beta testers use input statements to filter the data for their weather preferences, which will be used to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. 
- From the list of potential travel destinations, the beta tester will choose four cities to create a travel itinerary. 
- Finally, using the Google Maps Directions API, I created a travel route between the four cities as well as a marker layer map.

## Assignment Results
Considerations: In the new app, the count of random latitudes and longitudes was incresed from 1,500 to 2,000 and "Weather Description" was added to the output.

### Beta Testers Chosen 4 Cities:
- Truth Or consequences
- Winslow
- Price
- Barstow
